# The Ball Game

My first Hackathon experience! This game was developed for the August 2021 Mintbean Hackathon. It is based in Breakout, an arcade game developed and published by Atari, Inc. in 1976. HTML5's Canvas was used to set the area and draw the game and the logic was coded with JavaScript. [Play the game!](https://theballgame.netlify.app/)ðŸŽ®

## Instructions:

Move the paddle to the right or left (use either the arrows on your keyboard, your mouse or touch your screen), do not let the ball fall down. Once you had destroyed all the bars, you win! ðŸ˜ƒ
